The goal of this project was to develop a cardiovascular disease risk assessment screening tool to predict risk of heart attack and stroke among adults using self-reported information. This would in turn could be used to get a probability of an individual developing cardiovascular disease based on a short questionnaire and evaluate risk score.

The dataset was obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) – a population-based program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. It is conducted by Center of Disease Control’s (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) on a sample of the U.S. population of all ages to reflect the nation overall, rather than individual states or counties. 5-year (2011-2016) demographics, examination, laboratory and questionnaire data was collected from NHANES for 60, 936 individuals.

After data cleaning and processing, the target feature CVD_risk showed unequal distribution of classes with 12,878 negative classes and 1,611 positive classes, corresponding to 1:8 ratio between positive and negative class. Therefore, specialized sampling techniques were employed to handle class imbalance.

This approach can help transform the health insurance industry in two ways: they can provide new sources of insight to simplify and streamline current underwriting, and they can enhance the understanding of risk to enable more refined, granular categorizations of risk.
