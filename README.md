# Development and Validation of Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction Tool: A Machine Learning Approach

The goal of this project was to develop a cardiovascular disease risk assessment screening tool to predict risk of heart attack and stroke among adults using self-reported information. This would in turn could be used to get a probability of an individual developing cardiovascular disease based on a short questionnaire and evaluate risk score.
